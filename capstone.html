  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <p>For my capstone project, I created advanced AI software in Python. This software utilizes machine learning, which is a technology enabling computers to learn and make intelligent decisions from data patterns, without explicit programming. My project highlights the potential of AI to autonomously learn and adapt.</p>
  <h1>Goal</h1>
  <p>The goal of our project is to make an ai play connect 4, and improve through data of previous games. After this is successful, we want to be able to utilize this ai online, only using autonomous movements.</p>
  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <img src="steps.png">
  <ol>
    <h1>ALPHA</h1>
    <li>Make a workable connect 4 game in python.</li>
    <li>Make an ai that uses basic strategy.</li>
    <li>Be able to save game information to a csv file.</li>
    <li>Save 1 thousand unique game states to a csv file.</li>
    <li>Make different machine learning models, using the data created.</li>
    <li>Test accuracy of the models.</li>
    <h1>BETA</h1>
    <li>Read the website screen using a pillow.</li>
    <li>Convert the screen into a 2-d array containing the state of the game.</li>
    <li>Use mouse to input the move.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>If I were to redo</h1>
  <p>Change it to chess -  I was intimidated because I thought it would be too difficult. However, the only real changes would be creating the options for different moves.</p>
